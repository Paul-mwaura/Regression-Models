# Specifying Questions
> This repository covers the appilcation of Lasso regression on a dataset.

> In this project you have explored the basics of regularization. Regularization can prevent machine learning models from being overfit.

> Regularization is required to help machine learning models generalize when placed in production. Selection of regularization strength involves consideration of the bias-variance trade-off.

> L1 regularization is also known as Lasso regression.

> L2 regularization is also known as Ridge regression.

> L2 and l1 regularization constrain model coefficients to prevent overfitting. L2 regularization constrains model coefficients using a Euclidian norm.

> L2 regularization can drive some coefficients toward zero, usually not to zero. On the other hand, l1 regularization can drive model coefficients to zero.
